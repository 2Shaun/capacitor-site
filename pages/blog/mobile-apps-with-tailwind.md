Capacitor runs standard web apps natively on iOS, Android, Desktop, and Web. As such, any popular web technologies and libraries can be used to build mobile apps with Capacitor.

Few libraries are as popular and fast growing as [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/), a utility-first CSS framework that replaces the need to write custom class names or even any CSS at all in many cases. It's useful for building responsive websites and as the foundation for component libraries.

Tailwind on its own would not be sufficient for building a native-quality app, as it's missing standard mobile UI layouts and interactions. To make it easier to use Tailwind for mobile app development, Ive put together a starter project using React + Next.js, Tailwind CSS, and Capacitor.

## Introducing the Next.js + Tailwind CSS + Capacitor Starter

Interested in building mobile apps that look and feel like this using standard HTML/CSS/JS and Tailwind?

This starter comes with common Mobile UI controls built with Tailwind that can be easily customized to fit your app design.

## How does this compare to Ionic Framework?

This Tailwind approach would be better suited to an advanced developer who is comfortable customizing and maintaining these components in their app. If you need full control over every last detail of your design, and are comfortable building your own UI controls as you build out your app, then this approach could be great for you.

If, instead, you'd prefer a batteries-included approach with 100+ components pre-built for you, but not meant to be styled using Tailwind and with a more opinionated approach, [Ionic Framework](https://ionicframework.com/) could be a better fit.

At the end of the day, there are a lot of great options for all kinds of developers and this starter is just one way to do it!
